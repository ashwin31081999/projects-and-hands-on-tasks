DevOps Engineer Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my DevOps portfolio! This repository showcases my hands-on experience across a variety of tools and technologies like AWS, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines. Below are the detailed descriptions of the key projects I've worked on.

Table of Contents
Deploy a NodeJS Application
Kubernetes Deployment with EKS and CI/CD
CI/CD Pipeline for Python Application
AWS Infrastructure Automation Using Terraform
AWS Resources Project Using Management Console
1. Deploy a NodeJS Application
Description: Dockerized a NodeJS application and set up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.
Tools Used:
Docker
Jenkins
AWS EC2
Prometheus
Grafana
CloudWatch
Key Highlights:
Wrote bash scripts (build.sh for building Docker images and deploy.sh for deploying to AWS).
Created two Docker Hub repositories for dev (public) and prod (private) environments.
Implemented CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins, automating builds and deployments from GitHub branches (dev and master).
Deployed the application on AWS EC2, securing it with IP-restricted access.
Monitored application health using Prometheus, Grafana, and AWS CloudWatch.
2. Kubernetes Deployment with EKS and CI/CD
Description: Automated the deployment of a microservices application on a Kubernetes cluster using EKS and Jenkins CI/CD.
Tools Used:
AWS EKS
Docker
Jenkins
AWS ECR
Key Highlights:
Built Docker images for the microservices and pushed them to AWS ECR.
Integrated Kubernetes with Jenkins for automated deployment in different environments.
3. CI/CD Pipeline for Python Application
Description: Developed a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying a Python application.
Tools Used:
Jenkins
Docker
AWS EC2
GitHub
Key Highlights:
Automated the entire pipeline, from code commit to deployment.
Utilized Docker for containerization and Jenkins for pipeline management.
4. AWS Infrastructure Automation Using Terraform
Description: Automated AWS infrastructure provisioning using Terraform.
Tools Used:
Terraform
AWS (VPC, EC2, S3, DynamoDB)
Key Highlights:
Built custom VPC with public/private subnets, route tables, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway.
Automated the provisioning of EC2 instances in the public subnet with Apache web server deployment.
Utilized S3 for storing Terraform state and DynamoDB for state file locking.
Modularized Terraform configurations for dev and prod environments.
5. AWS Resources Project Using Management Console
Description: Deployed a project that utilized AWS services to create a scalable infrastructure using the management console.
Tools Used:
AWS (VPC, EC2, Elastic IP, NAT Gateway, Auto-scaling Groups, ALB)
Key Highlights:
Created VPC, subnets, route tables, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway.
Set up auto-scaling groups with private EC2 instances running Nginx and Apache.
Configured an Application Load Balancer to route traffic.
